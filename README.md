*Abstract*



In the ongoing investigations in metropolitan cities,
population growth produces high vehicle density on
roads. As a result, this leads to an annoying problem
it&#39;s hard to find a space for drivers to leave their
vehicles. This paper introduces web-based automatic
smart parking system for vehicles. in this We have
proposed a system that can easily manage the parking
system on paper. Different sensor networks. This
system can easily find and control a parking space.
Whether the user parked the vehicle. Also, this
system can create unlimited locations and add slots to
these locations. This is a multi-user parking lot
system where a single application can run for
multiple locations. this parking lot the system will
increase the probability of successful parking and
minimize waiting time. user time in addition, this
parking management system Track parking spaces
and make the parking process a hassle-free
experience. Traffic congestion is one of the most
important problems of urban transportation. high
energy consumption and air pollution. Lack of free
parking spaces one of the main causes of traffic
congestion. Congestion and parking are interrelated
because searching for free parking creates additional
delays and local circulation. 10% of traffic
circulation in the center of big city It&#39;s on the road as
drivers spend almost 20 minutes searching for an
empty parking lot. Then It is necessary to develop a
parking space availability estimation system that can
notify drivers in advance by location, by day, and by
hour occupancy rate of parking lots. In this article,
we have proposed a framework with a deep
foundation. long-short-term memory network to
predict parking space availability With Integration of
Internet of Things (IoT), cloud technology and sensor
networks. We use the Birmingham parking sensors
dataset to
evaluate its performance. deep long-term memory
networks. There are three types of experiments:
• Performed to estimate the availability of free
parking space based on
• Location, days of the week and working hours of
the day. Experimental results show
• The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art
prediction models.
